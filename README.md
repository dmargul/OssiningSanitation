# (Readable) Ossining Sanitation & Recycling Schedule 2024

## Motivation
Every year, the Village of Ossining distributes a schedule to all residents detailing the schedule of garbage and recycling collections. 

After living in Ossining for a short time, I became obsessed with redesigning [this human rights violation](https://www.villageofossining.org/public-works/files/2024-sanitation-schedule).

## Design
I have identified the following major issues with the original design:
1. Residents of 'Zone 1' and 'Zone 2' have different schedules, but both schedules are shown on a single calendar.
2. A list of holidays occupies a large amount of space while providing no additional information.
3. On the day when one is likely to place a blue recycling bin at the curb, the date is marked in red. On the day when one is likely to place a green recycling bin at the curb, the date is marked in blue.
4. Weekends are shown, but they are never needed.

In addition, November 22, 2024 is erroneously colored to indicate Zone 1 garbage pickup will occur when it will not.

The general result of all this is a calendar that takes an unusually large amount of effort to understand.

In this repository, you will find separate calendars for Zone 1 and Zone 2, in SVG and PDF formats.

## Code
I will share the code used to generate the *.svg files when it is less of an embarrassment. The *.pdf files, included for convenience, were created with Windows Print to PDF.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to the garbage, recycling, and leaf collectors of the Village of Ossining, who unlike me have a real job and make our lives better. 
And thank you in advance to the Ossining Department of Public Works for being good sports about the whole "human rights violation" thing.
